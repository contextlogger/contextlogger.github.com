<h1>1. Logger</h1>
<a id="toc2" name="toc2"></a>
<h2>1.1. Design Overview</h2>
<p>
The solution is based on client software installed on a phone that (typically) runs on the background, unintrusively recording information about activities taking place on the phone. The implementation makes heavy use of event-driven programming, an <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database engine, and a <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> runtime. More specifically: each &ldquo;sensor&rdquo; runs independently as its own &ldquo;active object&rdquo;, reacting to system events; all persistent data (including any logged data) is managed with SQLite; and configurability of the system revolves around the lightweight dynamic language Lua.
</p>
<a id="toc3" name="toc3"></a>
<h2>1.2. General Design Guidelines</h2>
<p>
The implementation of the logger daemon has been influenced by these guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Be unintrusive.

  <ul>
  <li>Do not bother the user with questions.
  
  </li>
  <li>Important and infrequent error messages may be displayed.
  
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Treat data sources uniformly, for purposes of maintainability.

  <ul>
  <li>Each sensor should have its own logger "active object" that runs independently of others.
  
  </li>
  <li>Code generation may be utilized in integrating a sensor object with the rest of the framework. (The database access boilerplate code is presently automatically generated for most sensors.)
  
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Do not waste resources.

  <ul>
  <li>Frequently executed code (as typically found in sensors) should be written tightly.
  
  </li>
  <li>No heavy runtimes are to be used (unless the platform requires it).
  
  </li>
  <li>Use compilers for optimization and increased abstraction&#8212;"execute" code already at compile time, and treat C (and C++) as portable assembly.
  
  </li>
  <li>Consider including compile-time options for disabling added features, to allow for optimization for a given use case by removing unneeded features.
  
  </li>
  <li>Particularly for energy-hungry "active" sensors, make it possible to configure the scanning frequency at runtime, and to start/stop the sensor at any time, e.g., to regulate battery consumption.
  
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Be platform-independent where feasible and sensible.

  <ul>
  <li>There currently is no dominant smartphone platform, and the platform landscape is evolving at a fast pace. There are standard or widely available languages and libraries, however, so favor them for reasons of portability.
  
  </li>
  <li>Consider abstracting away machine specifics (such as size and endianness of data items) in your code.
  
  </li>
  <li>Hide platform-dependencies under interfaces that could potentially be implemented for other platforms as well.
  
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Strive for robust error handling.

  <ul>
  <li>Try to ensure that errors that matter do not go unnoticed by the logger.
  
  </li>
  <li>Consolidate recoverable error handling to suitably high-level code that has enough context information to actually decide how to handle an error. This way you also avoid cluttering all of your code with error handling logic.
  
  </li>
  <li>And yes, also handle out-of-memory errors gracefully.
  
    <ul>
    <li>In particular, ensure that any Qt or GLib out-of-memory errors are treated as fatal as said libraries were not originally designed to support OOM recovery, and may potentially leak resources in out-of-memory error situations.
    
    </li>
    <li>In fact, for consistency, better consider all out-of-memory errors as fatal. Still, log any and all errors before daemon process exit if possible.
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.3. Adding a New Sensor</h2>
<p>
The steps to take when adding a new sensor are typically like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a database table for recording the sensor readings in <code>src/sa_sensor_list_spec.ss</code>. If you want a compile-time option for the sensor, specify it here; something like <code>``__SENSORNAME_ENABLED__``</code>.

</li>
<li>If you have a compile-time option for the sensor, enable it for desired variant builds by editing the <code>variants/*.var.ss</code> files. If you want to compute a default setting based on other compile-time configuration options, you can do this in <code>variants/base.ss</code>.

</li>
<li>Take a similar sensor implementation as a template for the interface and implementation files. (An example of such files would be <code>src/epoc-cellid.hpp</code> and <code>src/epoc-cellid.cpp</code>.) Copy, rename, and modify to implement your required sensor.

</li>
<li>Add an <code>#include</code> for the header file of your sensor in <code>src/sa_array.cpp</code>. Also add a <code>DECLARE_SENSOR_sensorname</code> style declaration, or otherwise declare your sensor active object in the <code>_sa_Array</code> object.

</li>
<li>List your implementation file in <code>Makefile</code> and/or the <code>src/module.mmp.in</code> file as appropriate. (The former is required for Linux builds, whereas the latter is required for Symbian builds.) Again, if you had a compile-time option for your sensor, you may want to make use of it here.

</li>
<li>If your sensor implementation relies on system DLLs, you should ensure they are listed in <code>Makefile</code> and/or <code>src/module.mmp.in</code> as appropriate. Again, if you had a compile-time option for your sensor, you may want to make use of it here; this is particularly important if the libraries used are not included in all SDKs.
</li>
</ol>

As an example of the code required for a single sensor, below is a patch showing a sensor implemented based on the <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Adaptive_History_List_API">Adaptive History List API</a>:

<h2>3.1. Koog</h2>
<p>
<a href="../koog/">Koog</a> is a mixed-code generation tool that we have used in maintaining the logger codebase, mostly interactively under Emacs. In case you're wondering about the <code>/***koog***//***end***/</code> style comments found in the code. If these comments get on the way, feel free to delete them. It <i>is</i> quite possible to maintain the boilerplate code manually as well.
